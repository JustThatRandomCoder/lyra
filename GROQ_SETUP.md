# Groq AI Setup Instructions

Your playlist generator now uses Groq AI for intelligent, genre-specific song recommendations! ðŸŽµðŸ¤–

## Quick Setup (2 minutes):

1. **Get your FREE Groq API key:**

   - Visit: https://console.groq.com/keys
   - Sign up with your email (it's completely free!)
   - Create a new API key

2. **Add the key to your .env file:**

   - Open `/server/.env`
   - Replace `gsk_your_free_key_here` with your actual Groq API key
   - Example: `GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz`

3. **Restart your server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

## What's New:

âœ… **AI-Powered Recommendations:** True AI generates songs based on your exact genre + mood combinations
âœ… **Genre-Specific Results:** Want "happy techno"? You'll get techno songs that are happy, not pop songs that are happy
âœ… **More Variety:** AI creates unique playlists every time with mix of popular hits and hidden gems
âœ… **Smoother Animations:** Enhanced UI with fluid transitions and micro-interactions
âœ… **Fallback System:** If AI is unavailable, falls back to curated database

**Note:** The app works perfectly without the API key too - it will use our curated music database as a fallback!
